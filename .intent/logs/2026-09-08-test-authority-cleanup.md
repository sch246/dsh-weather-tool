# Test maintenance scope

The user authorized removal of product-behavior tests while retaining necessary external-contract and mechanical-invariant checks. Confirmed intent belongs in STATE, not a parallel assertion suite. The shared meta-intent Agent entry carries this rule.

Removed 0 complete test files; mixed files retain only the applicable grounded checks. Unused runner entries, UI test dependencies and fixtures were removed where no retained consumer uses them. Runtime source and live profile are unchanged.

The mixed weather file retains key/host validation, Ed25519 JWT signing and authenticated HTTP request checks. Product fallback/default-location and mocked registration assertions were removed.

No tests or builds were run for this cleanup. Syntax, manifest/reference consistency and diff checks are static evidence only.
